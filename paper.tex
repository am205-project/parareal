\section{Abstract}

We implement the parareal algorithm to solve various ODEs and compare in terms of accuracy, speedup and efficiency.  We explore the effect of using differnt solution operators (a course and a fine as required by the method)  The majority of our code is written in python using mpi4py to parallelize.  To compare to more performance-based languages, we compare certain codes to an implementation in C++.

\section{Background}

\subsection{Numerical Methods and Parallelization}
Solving systems of differential equations can be a computationally expensive task.  The error of most algorithms scales on the stepsize of the discretization of time.  However, stepsize in time is also proportional to the computation required.  The parareal algorithm, developed by YADA YADA.  An alternative would be to parallelize by space -

\section{Methodology}

The general parareal method, as described by YADA YADA can be SEEN BELOW YAR

\begin{algorithm}[t]
 \KwIn{Replication parameter $C$.}
 \KwIn{$P$ processors arranged into $C$ rows and $T=P/C$ teams.}
 \KwIn{Set $\mathcal{T}$ of $N$ particles and associated charges and results.}
 In parallel on all processors, $r = $ rank\;
 Scatter particles from master to team leaders, $\mathcal{T}_t$\;
 Broadcast $\mathcal{T}_t$ from team leader to team members\;
 Copy $\mathcal{T}_t$, the set of targets, to $\mathcal{S}_t$, the set of sources\;
 Given $c$th member of team $t$, shift $\mathcal{S}_t$ by $c$ along row\;
 \For{\normalfont{iteration} $i < 1$}{
   Compute symmetric interaction of $\mathcal{T}_t$ and $\mathcal{S}_t$\;
 }
 Reduce the results within a team\;
 Gather the results between team leaders\;
